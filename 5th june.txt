split() method to split the string stored in $request->parent_cv_name into an array.

*****           $request->parent_cv_name: This retrieves the string "John#_#Doe#_#30#_#New York" from $request->parent_cv_name.

               Str::of($request->parent_cv_name): This creates a Str object from the string "John#_#Doe#_#30#_#New York".

               split('/#_#/'): This splits the string into an array using the delimiter /#_#/. So, the string will be split at every occurrence of #_#. After splitting, the resulting array will be:
               
[
    "John",
    "Doe",
    "30",
    "New York"
]
